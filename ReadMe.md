An alarm clock web-app I built a while back in pure vanilla JS using the MVC design pattern. At some point, I would like to make this into an electron app, that would be fun!

To check it out, you will need to fork the app. Open up index.html from the folder, it should directly load all the resources needed and you can view what the app will look like.
